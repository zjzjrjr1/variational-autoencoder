# Variational Autoencoder for Cifar10 and MNIST

## Project Description

This project is variational autoencoder described in the pdf file included. 

The code can accept CIFAR10 and MNIST. 

"k" hyperparameter controls the dimension of the latent space.
"beta" hyperparameter controls the Kullback-Leibler loss weighting vs the reconstruction loss weighting.
